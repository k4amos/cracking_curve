# Password Cracking Progress Visualization

A real-time visualization tool for monitoring Hashcat / [Autocat](https://github.com/k4amos/Autocat) password cracking progress with interactive curves.

Exemple of two cracking curves from this 2014 [public leak](https://github.com/YoureIronic/Historical-Data-Breaches-Archive/blob/main/breaches/Dominos/index.md) :

## Basic Usage

When you run Hashcat, you must add the following argument : `--status-json --status-timer 1 --status | tee save_output`. This allows you to save the logs of your cracking process (one log per second) in an easily parsable format to the file of your choice, in the example `save_output`.

```bash
hashcat [options] --status-json --status-timer 1 --status | tee save_output
```

You can then (during or after cracking) run the following command to visualize the generated cracking curve:

```bash
# Single file
python password_cracking_curve.py save_output
```

You can visualize multiple cracking curves (from different files) simultaneously to compare them :

```bash
# Multiple files
python password_cracking_curve.py save_output_1 save_output_2 save_output_3

# All files in directory
python password_cracking_curve.py *
```

It also works with [Autocat](https://github.com/k4amos/Autocat) which allows you to easily create cracking sequences and automatically uses the potfile as a wordlist, as you can see in the image above.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Dash
- Plotly
- Hashcat (for generating input data)

## Installation

```bash
pip install dash plotly
```

### Command Line Arguments


| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `files` | Path(s) to hashcat JSON output file(s) (required) | - |
| `--host` | Server host address | 127.0.0.1 |
| `--port` | Server port | 8050 |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message | - |

## Other Tools

- [Autocat-training](https://github.com/k4amos/Autocat-training) : Autocat-training aims to solve the **knapsack problem** using a **greedy algorithm** to determine the **most optimal password cracking sequence** for cracking a given input list of hashes and a list of cracking methods (wordlists, rules, brute-force) that you can specify.
- [Autocat](https://github.com/k4amos/Autocat) : This tool makes it easy to run a cracking sequence with Hashcat without launching each method 'by hand'. Moreover, at the end of each method, the new passwords recovered in plaintext in the potfile are used as a wordlist together with a rule, which significantly improves cracking performance. This tool is pre-configured to crack French passwords: a large benchmark was run with Autocatâ€‘training with a significant number of French hashes from various sources, which were cracked using a GPU. The sequence obtained is Autocat's default, but it is possible to define a custom sequence for other languages.
